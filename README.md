# Search DMV Command

This discord.js command will only work for those who own NAT2K15's [DMV Script](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/DMV-Script) and his [FiveM Bot V2](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/fivem-botv2) or Framework Bot ([V1](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/fivem-framework) or [V2](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/framework-v2)).

(ps. [V2](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/framework-v2) is better ðŸ˜‰)


# How to install

Simply drag and drop into the commands folder (Pick the right command), restart your bot and boom!

### Usage
```!dmv <discordid>```
* Please do it without the <>
* Replace `!` with your prefix set in the config.

## Help
* If you get a label next to ```Name``` In the bed saying ```Invalid``` it means you do not own NAT2K15's [Framework](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/framework-v2).
* You can fix this by either purchasing it lol or completely removing line ```29``` from the [FiveM Bot V2](https://github.com/lucasmckillop/search-dmv/blob/main/Framework%20Bot/dmv.js) command or line ```28``` from the [Framework](https://github.com/lucasmckillop/search-dmv/blob/main/Framework%20Bot/dmv.js) command.
