# Search DMV Command

This discord.js command will only work for those who own NAT2K15's [DMV Script](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/DMV-Script) and his [FiveM Bot V2](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/fivem-botv2) or Framework Bot ([V1](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/fivem-framework) or [V2](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/framework-v2)).

(ps. [V2](https://store.nat2k15.xyz/store/framework-v2) is better 😉)


# How to install

Simply drag and drop into the commands folder, restart your bot and boom!
